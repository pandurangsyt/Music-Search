# Music-Search
This project loosely follows MVC model, given more time, effective MVC can be followed for better results. Also not all corner cases are not considered, e.g. handling of unknown errors, incorrect string search, etc. 
Attention is given to functionality and ability to search using public API's. Used JSON parsing and webcontent parsing for reading the data
Also, there is scope for layout support for landscape
